# Otalex
Repository for storing all the construct queries needed to enhance the Otalex RDF, along with the website.
Each file includes an update construct to be run in virtuoso to update the legend.

The file OtalexConstructs includes the sources of a Java project to execute the queries in the respective folders. It can be used to update the repository quickly programatically,  instead of running each query separately.

The project depends on Jena (not included in the lib folder).
